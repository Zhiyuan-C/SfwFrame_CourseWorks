# Documentation
Following are the documentation required for assignment.

## Git

Github is a web-based hosting service that can perform version control use git, and it is used for this project to store and monitor the changes of project file. Student commites the change as frequenlty as possible, and pushes the code to remote repository when needed.

Four branches were created during the development.

### #master
master is the default main branch, once the code works after development from other branches, then will be merged here.

#### server
server is the branch that mainly dealing with creating, writing and modifing server side code, and how angular-cli comminicates to the back edn server. It does will not go in detail with the front end page presentation, and it is the place where most of the application functionality are developed.

#### frontEnd
frontEnd is the branch where writing and modifing code that in charges of front-end presentation of the application. 

#### reconstruct
reconstruct is the branch where when large amount of reconstruction needed, such as move, copy, delete numeriouse lines of code. it is rarely used.

The student commits all the changes and push the branch to the remote repository before checkout and merge other branch.


## Data Structures
Three classes are used for user, group and channel.
<!-- use javascript highlight, but remeber that the acutal javascript does not support to declar types -->
For User class
```javascript
class User {
    constructor(userName: string, userEmail: string, valid: boolean, superAdmin: boolean, groupAdmin: boolean, groupList: string[], adminGroupList: string[]){
        this.userName = userName;
        this.userEmail = userEmail;
        this.valid = valid;
        this.superAdmin = superAdmin;
        this.groupAdmin = groupAdmin;
        this.groupList = groupList;
        this.adminGroupList = adminGroupList;
    }
}
```
* `userName` and `userEmail` - for each user, a user name is required which is a string.
* `valid` - it is a boolean, which default state is false and true when user logged in.
* `superAdmin` and `groupAdmin` 
  * it is a boolean, depends on the role of the user, if user is assigned with the role, then is true, outherwise false. Default state is false.
* `groupList` - a list of group names that the user joining.
* `adminGroupList` - a list of group names that the user created.

For Group class
```javascript
class Group {
    constructor(groupName: string, groupUsers: string[], groupChannel: string[], groupAssist: string[]){
        this.groupName = groupName;
        this.groupUsers = groupUsers;
        this.groupChannel = groupChannel;
        this.groupAssist = groupAssist;
    }
}
```
* `groupName` - the name of the group that is a string.
* `groupUsers` - list of users that are in the group.
* `groupChannel` - list of channels that the group has.
* `groupAssist` - a list of users who have the group assist role.

For Channel class
```javascript
class Channel {
    constructor(channelName: string, channelUser: string[], groupBelong: string){
        this.channelName = channelName;
        this.channelUser = channelUser;
        this.groupBelong = groupBelong;
    }
}
```
* `channelName` - the name of the channel that is a string.
* `channelUser` - list of users that are in the channel.
* `groupBelong` - name of the group this channel belongs.

## REST API
Following is a graph represents how angular front-end communicate with Node.js server for this project.

![Alt RESTAPI](/doc-img/RESTAPI.png?raw=true)

## Angular Architectire

Following is a graph briefly illustrate the angular architectire for this project.

![Alt AngularArchitecture](/doc-img/AngularArchitecture.png?raw=true)

### Component and Routes
The component defines and controls the view. There are total eight components in this project currently. app component is the root compponent. Angular routes navigate relavent component view to be displaied in `router-outlet` under the app component. Following image illustrates each component and routes draftly.
![Alt ComponentRoutes](/doc-img/ComponentRoutes.png?raw=true)

### Services
The services mainly in charge of send httpClient request. It controls the communication between front-end and back-end server. The component calls the method from the service, service send request to the back-end `localhost:3000`, then return the request result as observable for the component to subscribe. The service also provide method for the component to pass the data, the service takes that data and make the data as observable data, which allows other component to subscribe the data.

There are two services in this project.
* UserAutenticationService
⋅⋅The user authentication service send request to server to retrieve the user detail. it is used for login user.
* UserInteractionService
..This service is used to send request to 
  * get user list, group list data
  * add user, group, channel
  * remove user, group, channel
  * modify user role

## State change
### Data binding
Template binding is used for display data.
#### One way biding
 Global varibles in the component.ts are declared on tope of the class above the constructor, and they are declared without let, var or const keyword. Double curly braces `{{}}`is used in the HTML template to display the global varible. it is bind together so whenever the global varible changes, the view will display the updated varible automatically.

#### Two way biding
Differ from one way biding, which only the view recevie the data from the control. Two way biding allows the control also recieves the data. It is mostly used in forms to retrieve user input. 
On the component.html 
add `[(target)]="expression"` to the hteml element, for example:
`<input [(ngModel)]="user">`
Then in the component.ts
Declear global variable with empty value, then retrieve the value use this keyword in the method. for example:
```typescript
user = ''; // initialise global variable with empty value
this.user // retrieve user input value
```

#### Event biding
`(click)` is used for event biding, and normally is in the button element like `<button (click)="method()"></button>`. Whenever the user click the button, it triggers the method indicated in the element to perform certain action.

#### Attributes biding
Attributes biding are also used in this project, and is mostly used for display a list of data that must have different attributes, so that relavent bootstrap element can work. It uses `attr.attrName`, and the HTML element will look like `<div [attr.data-target]="actionName"></div>`

### Structural directives
Structural directives are used for construct the HTML layout. ngIf, ngIfElse and ngFor are used in this project. 
**ngIf** - it add or remove the hTML element depends on the condition provide by the control. If the condition is true, then element will be added, otherwise the element will be removed from the view.
Example: `<div *ngIf="isActive"></div>`
**ngIfElse** - Similar to ngIf, the difference is instead of remove the element when condition is false, it add different element for display.
Example: if expression true, display element in ng-container, else display element in elseTemplate
```
<ng-container *ngIf="expression; else elseTemplate">
</ng-container>
<ng-template #elseTemplate>
</ng-template>
```
**ngFor** - This is used to display list/array data, it will add element for each item in the list.
Example: 
at component.ts
`items = [1, 2, 3]`
at component.html
`<div *ngFor="let item of items" class="pl-1">{{item}}</div>`
result
```
<div class="pl-1">1</div>
<div class="pl-1">2</div>
<div class="pl-1">3</div>
```
